      "comment": "Mercy and justice are demonstrated in the distribution of plunder to the vulnerable groups—those tortured, orphans, widows, and the elderly—underscoring the Maccabean commitment to communal care and equity, even amid military triumphs. This practice echoes key ethical priorities in Jewish tradition."
