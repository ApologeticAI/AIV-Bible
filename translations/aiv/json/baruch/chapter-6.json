      "comment": "The chapter closes with a final command not to fear idols—a central biblical principle. The spiritual meaning prefigures the Church's insistence on exclusive worship of the one true God. This passage also hints at the necessity of apostolic tradition that safeguards correct worship, linking true faith to the revealed worship established by God. The emphasis on exclusivity of worship and the futility of idols points toward the fullness of faith found in the continuity of apostolic teaching and those sacraments established directly by Christ Himself."
