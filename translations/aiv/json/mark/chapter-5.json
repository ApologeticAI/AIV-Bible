      "comment": "Here, Jesus speaks in Aramaic, personally addressing the child with tenderness. This direct command to 'arise' recalls similar miracles in the Old Testament where prophets, by the power of God, raise the dead (see 1 Kings 17:22, Luke 7:14). Unlike the prophets who pray, Jesus acts by his own authority, affirming his divine power. The literal raising also foreshadows the promise of resurrection to all believers, indicating both physical and spiritual restoration. This moment demonstrates Jesus acting as the true shepherd who cares intimately for each soul.",

      "comment": "The instantaneous response of the girl getting up shows the completeness of Jesus’ miracle and his authority over life and death. Her age, twelve, is significant; in Jewish tradition, twelve marks the threshold of responsibility and spiritual awakening, paralleling the twelve tribes of Israel and highlighting God’s covenantal faithfulness. Their overwhelming amazement suggests the divine nature of what has taken place, moving their hearts beyond mere intellectual belief toward a deeper, awe-struck faith. Historically, such acts foreshadow the fullness of life found through union with Christ, both now and in eternity."

      "comment": "Jesus often commands silence after performing a miracle, emphasizing humility and the hidden nature of divine works, and protecting the mystery of his mission until the appointed time. His instruction to feed her demonstrates practical compassion and points to the care for body and soul, reminiscent of post-resurrection appearances (Luke 24:41-43) where Jesus affirms his bodily reality by eating. This detail, subtle yet profound, anticipates the nourishing and sustaining roles entrusted to those who continue his ministry, drawing all believers into fuller participation in the mysteries he inaugurates."
